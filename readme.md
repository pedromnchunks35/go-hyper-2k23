# ROADMAP
## 1. Basics of Go Programming:
- [1.1] Learn the syntax, data types, variables, control structures, and functions in Go. [+ INFO](1.1/readme.md)
- [1.2] Understand how to work with packages, import statements, and organizing code into multiple files.
- [1.3] Get familiar with Go's idiomatic coding style and best practices.

## 2. Data Structures and Algorithms in Go:
- Study essential data structures such as arrays, slices, maps, and linked lists in Go.
- Learn common algorithms like searching, sorting, graph traversal, and recursion.
- Implement these algorithms in Go, focusing on efficient code and understanding time and space complexities.

## 3. Memory Management and Performance Optimization:
- Gain an understanding of Go's garbage collector and how it manages memory.
- Learn techniques for optimizing memory usage and reducing memory leaks.
- Explore Go's profiling tools to analyze and optimize performance bottlenecks in your code.

## 4. Concurrency and Goroutines:
- Go's concurrency model is a key feature. Learn about goroutines, channels, and the sync package.
- Understand how to write concurrent programs, handle race conditions, and synchronize access to shared resources.
- Practice designing concurrent systems and explore patterns like fan-out/fan-in, worker pools, and select statements.

## 5. Web Development with Go:
- Learn how to build web applications using popular Go web frameworks like Gin or Echo.
- Understand routing, handling HTTP requests and responses, and managing middleware.
- Explore database integration with Go using libraries like GORM or SQLx.

- Study Hyperledger Fabric's architecture, components, and smart contracts (chaincode).
- Learn how to develop chaincode using the Go programming language.
- Understand the transaction flow, state management, and endorsement policies in Hyperledger Fabric.

## 7. Native Packages and Contributing to Existing Projects:
- Dive into existing Hyperledger Fabric projects implemented in Go and study their codebase.
- Explore how to create native packages for existing Go libraries or contribute to open-source projects.
- Contribute to the Hyperledger Fabric community by fixing bugs, adding features, or writing documentation.

## 8. Building Projects and Real-World Applications:
- Apply your knowledge by building projects related to Hyperledger Fabric, such as decentralized applications or custom chaincodes.
- Create projects that involve distributed systems, cryptography, or blockchain technology.
- Continuously improve your skills by actively participating in the Go and Hyperledger Fabric communities, seeking feedback, and learning from experienced developers.
